# Exam Timetabling Web Application

## Overview

This project is a **web-based exam timetabling system** that allows a department manager to create exam periods, automatically generate exam schedules, detect conflicts, and allow students and professors to consult their schedules.

The application is composed of:

* A **backend API** (Flask) located in the `api/` folder
* A **frontend** (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) located in the `frontend/` folder
* **Scheduling and assignment scripts** used by the API

## Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* Flask
* MySQL (or compatible DB)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run the Application

### 1. Start the Backend API

From the **project root directory**:

```bash
python -m api.app_api
```

The API will run on:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

Health check:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/health
```

---

### 2. Open the Frontend

Use **Live Server** or any static server to open the HTML pages.

* Manager (Chef de département):

```
frontend/pages/manager.html
```

* Student:

```
frontend/pages/student.html
```

* Professor:

```
frontend/pages/professor.html
```

The frontend typically runs on:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5500
```

---

## Application Workflow

### Manager (Chef de département)

1. Create an exam period (start date, end date, description)
2. Generate the exam planning
3. Preview the planning
4. Detect conflicts (students, professors, rooms)

### Student

* Consult personal exam schedule

### Professor

* Consult invigilation (surveillance) schedule

---

## Notes on Scripts

### `generate_assign.py`

* Requires a `period_id` argument
* Example:

```bash
python generate_assign.py 1
```

* **This script is normally called automatically by the API** when clicking **Generate** in the Manager interface
* Manual execution is optional and only used for testing

---

## Common Errors & Fixes

### ❌ File not found: generate_assign.py

Cause: Running the script from the wrong directory

Fix:

```bash
cd exam_app-v4.0
python generate_assign.py <period_id>
```

### ❌ API not reachable

Cause: Backend not running

Fix:

```bash
python -m api.app_api
```

---

## Status

✅ Backend working
✅ Frontend working
✅ End-to-end workflow tested
